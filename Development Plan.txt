Development Plan (ongoing):
Slow down code - to familiarize myself with unity's touch input and remind myself how rigidbody functions work
	get hold input
	set drag
	gradually increase drag
	drag = 0 on input release

Setup mobile testing on my android

Swipe code - now that I understand touch input, I can get more complex with registering the direction of a swipe
	register a swipe input
	register direction of swipe vector
	apply force to gameobject
	apply aformentioned force in direction of swipe vector

Setup test environment
	setup walls/floors/floating circle
	setup environment collisions
	setup gameobject's collisions
	setup ball collision reactions - make it bouncy and ricochet off walls correctly
		detect when ball collides with environment

Swipe limit code - add in "energy" that you gain for each ricochet and use for each swipe
	setup "energy" int
	reduce energy per swipe
	increase energy per ricochet

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Add in Combo System:
	Add in score system that goes up by killing enemies & collecting points
	Add in score multiplier when you kill enemies, break chests, 
	Delay combo degredation while collecting coins

Physics:
	Ball needs to bounce off of walls without loosing speed
	Add grid background
	Reduce gravity the higher you go
	Stacking upwards speed as gravity lowers

Add Polish:
	Add Trail Effect
	Make coins gained from boxes fly out & home in on player
	Add effects to enemies, coins, etc.

Sound:
	Add increasing sfx on coin collecting, box breaking, combo increase
	Add music

Reduce overall gravity scale???
Reduce gravity scale as you get higher??? as an element of progression???
