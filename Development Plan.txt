Development Plan (ongoing):
Slow down code - to familiarize myself with unity's touch input and remind myself how rigidbody functions work
	get hold input
	set drag
	gradually increase drag
	drag = 0 on input release

Setup mobile testing on my android

Swipe code - now that I understand touch input, I can get more complex with registering the direction of a swipe
	register a swipe input
	register direction of swipe vector
	apply force to gameobject
	apply aformentioned force in direction of swipe vector

Setup test environment
	setup walls/floors/floating circle
	setup environment collisions
	setup gameobject's collisions
	setup ball collision reactions - make it bouncy and ricochet off walls correctly
		detect when ball collides with environment
		??? not sure yet

Swipe limit code - add in "energy" that you gain for each ricochet and use for each swipe
	setup "energy" int
	reduce energy per swipe
	increase energy per ricochet
	require >= 1 energy to swipe
